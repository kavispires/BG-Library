# BG-Library

This is a Board Game functions library that I am creating to support the board game scoring apps I've been developing for personal use. After creating a few apps, I noticed that several functions are used in all of them for different situations.

## Example

One of my apps that uses this library is Five Tribes Helper, which you may check it out here: [https://github.com/kavispires/fivetribeshelper](https://github.com/kavispires/fivetribeshelper)

## Documentation

Documentation is still underconstruction and will be available [here](https://kavispires.github.io/BG-Library).
